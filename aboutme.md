## Ahoy matey! 🏴‍☠️

My name is **Salvatore Giammanco** and I am a Software Developer currently looking for a job in Milan or Full-remote.
I worked for 3 years as a computer programmer and web designer, then i tried to study Natural Sciences at the University of Milan.
However I still want to make great software, and in this moment I need to take control of my live, move out from my parent's house and earn my way to freedom.

### What's my Mission?

I want to create technology, innovation and hope for a better future. And I will do it, by understanding how nature really works. Because we need sustainable systems which make us able to live on this planet, or others, for an **UNLIMITED** amount of time, without consuming the planet's resources until they are depleted, and we need it now!

Our society should work like an ecosystem, in symbiosis with nature.
